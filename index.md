##Home page 

Each of your public APIs needs a web page that is the hub that provides access to all information and tools associated with it.  By using the page’s sidebar, footer, and sub pages, you can directly include or link to each of the following components that exist for the API.  This allows for ready discover of anything which a potential developer may need, minimizing the effort that is asked of them and maximizing adoption.  This API homepage should be a webpage, not a downloadable Word or PDF, in order to provide ease of use as well as a further degree of permanence.  

*Your team should decide which of the following elements to include with your API, recognizing that ensuring a well-rounded and fully functional developer experience is the best recipe for your API's success.  The below list represents  elements for you to assemble with each API in order to deliver just such an experience.  Examples and suggested tools are included and can be readily copied and improved upon between agencies.*

##Documentation

API documentation should include all instructions and details that are necessary or useful for visiting developers who wish to use the API.  Common elements include: description of functionality and available information, protocol and format, list of end points, example API calls, error response codes, as well as any of the remaining items from this list.  This information is often listed in the body of the API homepage and should be generated by the technical producer of the API as well as any tools that have been used to generate the API itself.  The technical producer of the API should produce the documentation but by reviewing the documentation of other .gov APIs, you can decide what material is most important for you to include with your API.  

##Code samples

By including sample code snippets that consume the API in the API’s documentation, you provide easy to understand case studies for developers to clone, modify, and learn from.  Where possible, provide working samples in as many popular programming languages as possible, such as Javascript, PHP, Ruby, or Python.  

In order to more appropriately present them on the documentation page, the snippets can be easily presented using the `<code>` html tag or a [GitHub gist](http://gist.github.com).

* [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/developers)
* [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://developer.nrel.gov/doc/api/georeserv/app/sam/pvwatts#demo-application)
* [National Weather Service](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/mdl/XML/Design/WFS_example.php)
* [EnergyStar.gov](https://data.energystar.gov/developers/docs/energy-star-certified-clothes-washers)
* [HealthIndicators.gov](http://healthindicators.gov/Developers/Examples)


##Interactive sample

In addition to static code examples, you can also provide interactive tools that allow developers to modify the examples and see the change in results.  This simple addition supports a quick path towards understanding how the API functions.  

Numerous free and opensource tools provide this functionality, [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com) and [I/O Docs](https://github.com/mashery/iodocs) are two popular choices.


**.Gov Examples:**
* [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/developers)
* [EnergyStar.gov](https://data.energystar.gov/developers/docs/energy-star-certified-clothes-washers)



##SDKs

Software Development Kits (SDKs) are small software libraries that make it easy to employ the associated API with a specific programming language such as PHP or Ruby.  Since many developers have a programming language of choice, you can ensure faster adoption by more developers by offering these onramps in as many popular languages as possible.  SDKs are often hosted as projects in your agency’s GitHub account but should also be linked from the API’s homepage as well.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Department of Labor](http://developer.dol.gov/)
* [Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.gov/developer/sdk_sample.html)


##API Key Management

If developers are required to request an API key, the entire experience should be self-service and allow the developer to move forward once the key has been issued.  When an agency is publishing multiple APIs that use keys, a developer should be able to use the same key for each API instead of needing to register and keep track of individual ones.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Department of Labor](https://devtools.dol.gov/developer)
* [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/developers/tos/key_request.html)
* [National Climate Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token)
* [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://developer.nrel.gov/signup)
* [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration](https://mobile.fmcsa.dot.gov/developer/home.page)
* [EnergyStar.gov](https://data.energystar.gov/developers/docs/energy-star-certified-clothes-washers)

##Issue Tracker 

Developers need a clear and transparent means of reporting bugs or other issues that affect the API and the API producer needs a functional means of managing these items.  By ensuring this, the agency ensures the best customer service and best incentivizes API adoption.  Issue Trackers can be stood up for each API individually though it is more common to maintain one aggregate tracker to be made available at the developer hub level for use across all APIs 

Free and opensource tools exist to fulfill this functionality, but possibly the quickest and easiest means is to create a standalone repository for the API in the agency’s GitHub account and [employ the Issue Tracker functionality to receive and process developer feedback](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation).  In addition to being free, scalable, and requiring no infrastructure, this choice also has the added benefit of existing within the GitHub ecosystem that is the norm within the developer community.  This option also allows agency staff or other developers to subscribe to updates and receive alerts.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Department of Labor](https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/DOLAPI/issues)


##Contact Info

Developers still need to have the ability to contact agency staff directly and for this purpose, it is important to offer contact information for an API point of contact.  This is often done at the agency level by creating an email account at developer@agency.gov and forwarding it to one or several staff who work together to field the incoming messages.  This would allow the same contact information to be published at the developer hub level instead of requiring a unique point of contact to be listed for each API.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Department of Labor](http://developer.dol.gov/ContactUs.htm)
* [Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/developer-resources)
* * [National Broadband Map] (http://broadbandmap.gov/developer)
* [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://developer.nrel.gov/community)
* [U.S. Courts - PACER](http://www.pacer.gov/cmecf/developer/)


##API Roadmap

Any API will be more successful the more that its producers communicate with potential developers and inform them of the near- and long-term plans for the service.  One easy means of doing this is to articulate these plans via milestones.  

This can be done in many ways but one convenient and productive method is to employ the Milestones functionality of Github in the same fashion as with Issue Tracking (it is actually integrated within the Issues section of any repository, alongside the issue tracker but can be used in parallel).   This allows agency staff or other developers to subscribe to updates and receive alerts.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.gov/developer/ef_api.html#future)

##Changelog 

Over time, your API design may change and the documentation updated.  Providing a changelog allows your developers to see at a glance what has changed and to better understand what impact the changes may have on their use of your API.  This can be done by instituting version control for the API, with each update receiving a version number and including a bulleted list of changes.  It is also helpful to provide clear tract changes to the API documentation, a task that is automatically integrated into any documentation that you publish through GitHub.  By posting the full text into GitHub, all future edits will clearly reflect changes so that your developers can see at a glance what they need to know.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [National Weather Service](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/#xml_changes)
* [Commerce - Automated Export System](http://www.aesdirect.gov/support/weblink_api_updates.html)
* [HealthIndicators.gov](http://healthindicators.gov/Developers/ReleaseNotes)

##FAQ

Any common questions that developers ask may reflect confusion held by other potential users that turned away.  Maintaining a simple list of frequently asked questions and answers provides a simple utility today as well as a good catch-all for future disclaimers and loose information that may come to mind in the future.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Department of Labor](http://developer.dol.gov/faq.htm)
* [National Institute on Drug Abuse](http://www.drugabuse.gov/developers/nmassist/faq)
* [National Weather Service](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/)

##Widgets

A particularly advanced way to drive adoption of your API is to also offer embeddable widgets that consume the API for use by developers and non-experts alike.  Many sources of data are clear candidates for widgets that offer the most recent or popular items from the material.  APIs allow advanced integration of this data, but by offering simple widgets that non-experts can use for common implementations, the faster, easier turnaround for third-parties will drive interest and adoption at all levels.  

**.Gov Examples:**
* [Federal Communications Commission](http://my.fcc.gov/dashboard)
* [AIDSinfo](http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/widgets)
